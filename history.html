  <h1>The History of Blue Oak Lake</h1>
  <p class="subtitle"><span><i>Founded 1758</i></span></p>
  <div class="history">
    <p>Blue Oak lake is a fictitious community located in the Catskill region of New York State. &nbsp; It is surrounded by verdant forests, undulating mountains, swiftly moving streams and rivers, meandering creeks, waterfalls, and an abundance of wildlife.  &nbsp;The town land was originally purchased from the Algonquian Indians by William Penn in 1712. &nbsp; It was subsequently settled by early Dutch and English colonists.</p>

    <p>By 1789, the lake became mainly a recreational area frequented by urbanites from New York City.  &nbsp;Blue Oak Lake was and continues to be regularly stocked with fish and was noted for its abundance of bass, perch, pickerel, and bluegills. &nbsp; Environmental visionaries have strived to protect the lake's pristine landscape despite continued development.</p>

    <p>In 1815 a group of businessmen opened the Blue Oak Lake Lodge, New Yorkâ€™s first grand resort hotel. &nbsp; Before it fell into disrepair almost a century later, this grand lodge was visited by many important people who took inspiration from their scenic surroundings. &nbsp; Today,  the Blue Oak Lake Lodge has been restored to its original grandeur and continues to welcome visitors from around the world.</p>
